    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16 oz block whole milk mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 cups Italian style bread crumbs</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>tallow (beef fat)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTION</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the block of cheese into 1/2 inch thick sticks, a few inches tall (see blog photos). I had 20 pieces.</li>
      <li>Place the eggs in a bowl with 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tablespoon of water, and whisk to combine. Place the bread crumbs in a second bowl next to the eggs.</li>
      <li>Take a cheese stick and dip it into the egg, letting the excess drip off. Then coat it in the bread crumbs, shake off the excess, and place on a tray.  Repeat with the remaining cheese sticks.  </li>
      <li>Once each cheese stick has been breaded, take each one through the egg and bread crumbs again for a second coating, at a minimum. I prefer to bread the cheese sticks three times for a more robust shell, but two coats is sufficient to prevent the cheese from leaking during cooking.</li>
      <li>Freeze the mozzarella sticks, on the tray, for at least for two hours.</li>
      <li>Heat the tallow or frying fat of choice to 365F, using either a deep fryer or a heavy bottomed 8" saucepan monitored with a thermometer. You want the fat to come a few inches up the sides of the pan.</li>
      <li>Fry the mozzarella sticks in batches for about 2 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
      <li>Let the cheese sticks drain briefly on a paper towel, then serve promptly with marinara or your favorite dunking sauce. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
